Project Requirment and Implementation:

1) Google Colab for Data Processing on Attached Datasets:
- Prepared a notebook in Google Colab.
- Included code to import dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation.
- Apply Data Analysis Techniques.

2) Dashboard on Attached Dataset:
- Developed an interactive dashboard. 
- The dashboard displayed key information, trends, and insights extracted from the data.
- Considered the use of interactive charts, tables, and maps.
- Presented data in a way that is intuitive and informative for end users.

This is a dashboard created using Streamlit.
The purpose of this dashboard is to use the Python library and create an interactive web-based dashboard which can replicate the same as other visualization tools such as Microsoft Power BI or Tableau. 
The dashboard has the following functionality: 
1. You can select the year, and month from the filter panel.
2. You can select your dataset also, but the dataset must have identical fields as the dataset which have been used originally.

The Ultimate aim is to show how you can make a dashboard using the Python open-source library Named Streamlit.

- Used Microsoft Power BI to create reports and dashboards.
- Includes various data visualizations such as charts, pie charts, heat maps, etc.
- Maked sure the report is well organized and presents data in a clear and understandable way.
  
4) Bonita Workflow on a Use Case of Your Choice:
- Choosed a relevant use case that would benefit from an automated process. Describe it in a paragraph of text, making explicit the roles of the various actors and the workflows to be modeled
- Use Bonita BPM to model and implement the workflow.
- Executed the workflow.
- Included automated tasks, data-driven decisions, and integrations with mail mailers.
- Documented the workflow, explaining how each step contributes to the use case and how it handles data.
