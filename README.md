# weather-data-analysis-dash
This is a dashboard created using Streamlit.
The purpose of this dashboard is to use the Python library and create an interactive web-based dashboard which can replicate the same as other visualization tools such as Microsoft Power BI or Tableau. 
The dashboard has the following functionality: 
1. You can select the year, and month from the filter panel.
2. You can select your dataset also, but the dataset must have identical fields as the dataset which have been used originally.

The Ultimate aim is to show how you can make a dashboard using the Python open-source library Named Streamlit.
